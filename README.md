A no-nonsense encryption tool that works right in your browser. Encrypt messages with classic ciphers or RSA, then decrypt them no server needed. Built with vanilla JS for privacy nerds and curious learners.

## Features

- **Encrypt** text with:
  - Caesar cipher (shift letters)
  - VigenÃ¨re cipher (keyword-based)
  - RSA (secure public/private keys)
  - Base64 encoding
  - SHA-256 hashing

- **Decrypt** messages (except hashes)
- Save encrypted messages per user
- Copy results with one click
- Works offline after loading

## How to Use

1. **Login** (demo credentials: admin/password123)

For RSA:
- First encryption generates keys automatically

## Tech Used

- Plain JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Web Crypto API for RSA/SHA-256
- localStorage for user data
- CSS Flexbox/Grid for layout

## Setup

Just open `index.html` in any modern browser. No server needed.

## Notes

- All processing happens in your browser
- Keys never leave your device
- Refresh clears RSA keys unless exported
